Examining current widgets
-------------------------

Example::

	from z3c.form import form

	class MyForm(form.Form):
	
	    def updateWidgets(self):
	        """ Customize widget options before rendering the form. """
	        form.Form.updateWidgets(self)
	        
	        # Dump out all widgets - note that each <fieldset> is a subform and this function only
	        # concerns the current fieldset
	        for i in self.widgets.items():
	        	print i
	        	
	        	
Modifying a widget
-----------------

Widgets are stored in form.widgets dictionary. Mapping is field name -> widget. Widget label can be different than field name.

Example::

	
	from z3c.form import form

	class MyForm(form.Form):
	
	    def updateWidgets(self):
	        """ Customize widget options before rendering the form. """
	
			self.widgets["myfield"].label = u"Foobar"
	
	
Creating forms dynamically
--------------------------

z3c.form assumes you have a static schema which you turn to a form. Always this is not the case and you might need to generate forms dynamically.

Getting group name
