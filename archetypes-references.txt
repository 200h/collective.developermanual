Archetypes ReferenceFields
---------------------------
Archetypes comes with a kind of field called ReferenceField which is used
to store references to other Archetypes objects, or any object providing the
IReferenceable interface.

References are mantained in the uid_catalog and reference_catalog catalogs. You
can find both at the root of your Plone site. Check them to see their indexes
and metadata. 

Althought you could use the ZCatalogs API to manage Arhchetypes references,
these catalogs are rarely used directly. The Products.Archetypes.interfaces
IReferenceable and IReference APIs are used instead.

Example declaration of a ReferenceWidget inside a schema::

    MyCTSchema = atapi.Schema((
    ...
        atapi.ReferenceField('myReferenceField',
            relationship = 'somerelationship',
            ),
    ...
    ))

Archetypes reference fields just store the UID (Universal Object Identifier)
of an object providing the IReferenceable interface. Continuing with the example
above, you will usually use the regular field API (getters/setters)::

    >>> areferenceableobject_uid = areferenceableobject.UID()
    >>> myct1.setMyReferenceField(areferenceableobject_uid)
    >>> myct1.getMyReferenceField() == areferenceableobject
    True

TODO:
Code to exercise the IReferenceable API, including relationships and
back-references.
