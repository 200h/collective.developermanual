===================
PAS eats exceptions
===================

.. contents :: :local:

A broken user folder is one of the worst things that can happen in Zope: it can make it impossible to access any objects underneath the user folders level.

In order to secure itself against errors in plugins PAS ignores all exceptions of the common exception types: NameError, AttributeError, KeyError, TypeError and ValueError.

This can make debugging plugins hard: an error in a plugin can be silently ignored if its exception is swallowed by PAS.
