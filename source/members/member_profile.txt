Getting member profile properties
---------------------------------

*Note*: Following concerns vanilla Plone only. If you have customized membership behavior
it doesn't necessarily work.

Member profile properties (title, address, biography, etc.) are stored in portal_membership tool.

Available fields can be found in ZMI -> portal_membership -> Properties tab.

`ToolbarViewlet has some sample code <http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.layout/trunk/plone/app/layout/viewlets/common.py>`_
how to retrieve these properties.

Getting member fullname
=======================

In template you can do something along the lines::

    <tal:with-fullname define="membership context/portal_membership;info python:membership.getMemberInfo(user.getId()); fullname info/fullname">
        You are are <span class="name" tal:content="fullname" />
    </tal:with-fullname>

Note that this code won't work for anonymous users.
