Getting logged in member
------------------------

The following code will get authentication data for the logged in user.

Example::

	from Products.CMFCore.utils  import getToolByName

 	mt = getToolByName(context, 'portal_membership')
    if mt.isAnonymousUser(): # the user has not logged in
        False
    else:
        member = mt.getAuthenticatedMember()
        username = member.getUserName()

or in template::

	username context/portal_membership/getAuthenticatedMember/getUserName
