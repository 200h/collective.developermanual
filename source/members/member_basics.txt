Getting logged in member
------------------------

The following code will get authentication data for the logged in user.

Example::

    from Products.CMFCore.utils  import getToolByName

    mt = getToolByName(context, 'portal_membership')
    if mt.isAnonymousUser(): # the user has not logged in
        False
    else:
        member = mt.getAuthenticatedMember()
        username = member.getUserName()

or in template::

    username context/portal_membership/getAuthenticatedMember/getUserName

Groups
------

Getting available groups
========================

Possible through acl_users and source_groups folder which provide functionality to manipulate Plone groups.

Example::

	acl_users = site.acl_users
	groups = acl.source_groups.getGroupIds() # Iterable of id strings
