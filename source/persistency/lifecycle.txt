Object lifecycles
===================

Plone has different lifecycles for different objects

* In-process objects, or "static" objects are created when the server application is launched
  and they are gone when the application quits. Usually these objects are set-up during Plone
  initialization and they are read-only for served HTTP requests. Examples:

  Examples: request object itself, getSite() thread-local way to access the site object,
  request specific permission caches.

* Persistent objects:
