Transactions
================


Plone uses `ZODB database <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope_Object_Database>` which follows
`Multiversion concurrency control pararigm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control>`_.

Simply during the HTTP request Ploen completes all writes of the request processing or
none of the writes. There cannot end partially written data to database.

Transaction boundary events
----------------------------

It is possible to perform actions before transaction is written to the database.
