Transactions
================


Plone uses `ZODB database <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope_Object_database>` which follows
`Multiversion concurrency control pararigm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control>`_.

During the HTTP request process, Plone completes all modifications of the data or
none of them. There cannot end partially written data to database.

Using transactions
------------------

Normally transactions are managed by Plone and the developer should not be interested in them.

Special cases where one would want to manage transaction life-cycle may include

* Batch creation or editing of many items once

Example code

* `transaction source code <http://svn.zope.org/transaction/trunk/transaction/?rev=104430>`_.

Transaction boundary events
----------------------------

It is possible to perform actions before and after transaction is written to the database.
