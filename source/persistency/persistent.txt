====================
 Persistent objects
====================

Persistent objects will have their data transparently serialized to a
persistent storage when the transaction completes.

If your class inherits from higher level Plone base classes 
persistency is handled transparently for you. Plone also handles
transaction automatically for each HTTP request. Unless you wish
to do manual transactions there is no need to call transaction.commit().

If you want to do your own persistent classes please read the following

* `Writing a persistent class <http://docs.zope.org/zodb/zodbguide/prog-zodb.html#writing-a-persistent-class>`_

* `About persistent objects <http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZDG/current/Persistence.stx>`_

* `Persistent interface description <http://apidoc.zope.org/++apidoc++/Interface/persistent.interfaces.IPersistent/index.html>`_.


Lists and dictionaries
----------------------

If you modify objects inside persistent lists and dictionaries, the change is not automatically 
reflected to the parent container.

* `Modifying mutable objects <http://docs.zope.org/zodb/zodbguide/prog-zodb.html#writing-a-persistent-class>`_
