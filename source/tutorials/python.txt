Plone resources
================

`Plone Cheat Sheet <http://www.coactivate.org/projects/plonecheatsheet>`_. A single list of every technology you need to learn to develop with plone3, why you need it and how to learn it. A bit out of date, but a good overview nonetheless.

`Plone Trac <https://dev.plone.org/>`_ contains bug reports, Plone source code and commits. Useful when you encounter a new exception or you are looking for a reference how to use API.

`Plone source code in version control system <http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone>`_.

Zope resources
================

`Zope 3 API reference <http://apidoc.zope.org/>`_. Good source for up-to-date Zope Python API and ZCML references.

`Zope 2 book <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/source/>`_. This describes old Zope 2 technologies. The book is mostly good explaining some old things, but '''do not''' use it as a reference for building new things.

`Zope source code in version control system <http://svn.zope.org/>`_.

`Zope package guide <http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/Zope3PackageGuide>`_.
