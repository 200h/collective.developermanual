Python is the programming language used by Plone and Zope.

Plone and Zope resources
--------------------------

Plone resources
================

`Plone Cheat Sheet <http://www.coactivate.org/projects/plonecheatsheet>`_. A single list of every technology you need to learn to develop with plone3, why you need it and how to learn it. A bit out of date, but a good overview nonetheless.

`Plone Trac <https://dev.plone.org/>`_ contains bug reports, Plone source code and commits. Useful when you encounter a new exception or you are looking for a reference how to use API.

`Plone source code in version control system <http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone>`_.

Zope resources
================

`Zope 3 API reference <http://apidoc.zope.org/>`_. Good source for up-to-date Zope Python API and ZCML references.

`Zope 2 book <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/source/>`_. This describes old Zope 2 technologies. The book is mostly good explaining some old things, but '''do not''' use it as a reference for building new things.

`Zope source code in version control system <http://svn.zope.org/>`_.

`Zope package guide <http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/Zope3PackageGuide>`_.

Installing Python
-----------------

It is not recommended to use system-wide Python installation with Plone, as if Plone requires new package versions these might conflict with ones
installed for your operating system. Installing packages to system-wide Python installation always requires root priviledges and you can 
easily hose your box when doing Python development work.

Plone unified installers comes with its own, preconfigured, Python interpreter.

If you are a developer you might wish to use a custom build Python interpreter which allows you to fine tune package.
