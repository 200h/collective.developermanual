Plone and Zope resources
--------------------------

Plone resources
================

`Plone Cheat Sheet <http://www.coactivate.org/projects/plonecheatsheet>`_. A single list of every technology you need to learn to develop with plone, why you need it and how to learn it. A bit out of date, but a good overview nonetheless.

`Plone Trac <http://dev.plone.org/plone>`_ contains bug reports, Plone source code and commits. Useful when you encounter a new exception or you are looking for a reference how to use API.

`Plone source code in version control system <http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone>`_.

Zope resources
================

`Zope 3 API reference <http://apidoc.zope.org/>`_. Good source for up-to-date Zope Python API and ZCML references.

`Zope 2 book <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/>`_. This describes old Zope 2 technologies. The book is mostly good for explaining some old things, but '''do not''' use it as a reference for building new things.

`Zope source code in version control system <http://svn.zope.org/>`_.

`Zope package guide <http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/Zope3PackageGuide>`_.

Installing Python
-----------------

It is not recommended to use the system-wide Python installation with Plone. Plone may require new package versions which could conflict with ones
installed by your operating system. Installing packages to system-wide Python installation always requires root privileges and you could
easily hose your box when doing Python development work.

Plone unified installers comes with their own, preconfigured, Python interpreter.

If you are a developer you might wish to use a custom built Python interpreter which gives you more control over the configuration.
