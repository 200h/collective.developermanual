Information boxes

Below are some information boxes which are used across this documentation.

**Security warning**: This box is used when the outcome of a function might depend on Plone security features.
It means that the function behaves differently depending on who you are logged in and in which context you call
the function.

Example: invokeFactory() checks the logged in user permission whether he/she can create the content.

**Testing warning**: This box is used when the outcome of a function might be
different when code is run in unit or functional tests. Usually this is because
there is no normal HTTP request/response lifecycle and some HTTP request specific
caches are not being invalidated properly.

Example: Unit testing code does not respect RestrictedPython restrictions

**Deprecation warning**: This approach is not recommended anymore and the same
functionality can be achieved using newer technology.

Example: plone_skins based templates are discouraged
