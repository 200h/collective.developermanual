Dealing with Zope permissions in Python code.

Checking permission manually
----------------------------

The following code checks whether the logged in user
has a certain permission for the some object.

.. code-block:: python

    from AccessControl import getSecurityManager
    from AccessControl import Unauthorized

    # Import permission names as pseudo-constants strings from somewhere... see security doc for more info
    from Products.CMFCore import permissions

    def some_function(self, object):


        # This will
        if not getSecurityManager().checkPermission(permissions.ModifyPortalContent, object):
            raise Unauthorized("You need ModifyPortalContent permission to edit header animations")

         # ...
         # we have security clearance here
         #



Bypassing permission checks
---------------------------

The current user is defined by active security manager. In both restricted and unrestricted execution certain functions may do their own security checks (invokeFactory, workflow, search)
to filter out results. If function does its own security check, there usually exist a version without security check.

Example:

* context.restrictedTraverse() vs. context.unrestrictedTraverse()

* portal_catalog.searchResults() vs. portal_catalog.unrestrictedSearchResults()

To bypass the security checks do the following.

.. warning:: This is not a recommended practice in product code. Use only for testing

Example::

    from AccessControl import ClassSecurityInfo, getSecurityManager
    from AccessControl.SecurityManagement import newSecurityManager, setSecurityManager
    from AccessControl.User import nobody

    sm = getSecurityManager()
    try:
        user = sm.getUser()
        try:
            newSecurityManager(None, nobody)

            # Do priviledged code here
            callMyCode()
        except:
            # If special exception handlers are needed, run them here
            raise
    finally:
        setSecurityManager(sm)

Catching Unauthorized
---------------------

Gracefully failing when the user does not have a permission. Example::

        from AccessControl import Unauthorized

        try:
            portal_state = context.restrictedTraverse("@@plone_portal_state")
        except Unauthorized:
            # portal_state may be limited to admin users only
            portal_state = None


Creating permissions
--------------------

You don't create permissions, they "spring into existence".
Whatever that means.

Assigning permissions to users (roles)
--------------------------------------

Permissions are usually assigned to roles, which are assigned to users through
the web.

To assign a permission to a role, use profiles/default/rolemap.xml:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <rolemap>
      <permissions>
        <permission name="MyProduct: MyPermission" acquire="False">
          <role name="Member"/>
        </permission>
      </permissions>
    </rolemap>
