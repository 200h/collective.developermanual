Introduction
------------

Here are useful information and snippets when hosting Plone behind Apache.

www-redirects
-------------

If you wish to force people to use your site with or without www prefix you can use 
the rules below. Note that setting this kind of rule is very useful from the search
engine optimizatin point of view also.

Example in <VirtualHost> section::

  <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>

           ServerName site.com   
           ServerAlias www.site.com
        
        
          <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
               RewriteEngine On
               RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.\site\.com [NC]
               RewriteRule (.*) http://site.com$1 [L,R=302]
        
           </IfModule>

Proxying other site under Plone URI space
-----------------------------------------

The following rule can be used to put a static web site to sit in the
same URI space with Plone. Put these rules **before** VirtualHost ProxyPass.

Examples::

   ProxyPass /othersite/ http://www.some.other.domain.com/othersite/
   ProxyPassReverse /othersite/ http://www.some.other.domain.com/othersite/
   
Redirecting certain URIs to old site
-------------------------------------

This is useful if you migrate to a Plone from some legacy technology 
and you still need to have some part of the URI space to 
point to the old server.

* Create alternative domain name for the existing old site (e.g. www2)

* Modify Apache configuration so that URLs still being used
  are redirected to the old server with alternative name, Put in this rewrite
  
::

          <location /media>
                  RedirectMatch /media/(.*)$ http://www2.site.fi/media/$1
          </location>
