Introduction

This page contains instructions how to configure Zope application server.

Timezone
----------

Add to [instance] in buildout.cfg::

        zope-conf-additional=
            
            <environment>
                TZ Europe/Helsinki
            </environment>
            
Creating additional debug instances
------------------------------------

You might want to keep your production buildout.cfg and development configuration
in sync automatically as possible. 

A good idea is to use same buildout.cfg on every environment.
If conditional things, like setting debug mode on, are needed, you can extend the buildout 
sections, which in turn create "additional Zopes" under bin/ folder::

        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        zope2-location = ${zope2:location}
        user = admin:x
        http-address = 8080
        debug-mode = off
        verbose-security = off
        
        ...
           
        environment=
            PTS_LANGUAGES=en fi
        
        #
        # Create a launcher script which will start one Zope instance in debug mode
        #
        [debug-instance]
        # Extend the main production instance  
        <= instance
        
        # Here override specific settings to make the instance run in debug mode
        debug-mode = on
        verbose-security = on
        event-log-level = DEBUG
                
And now you can start your **development** Zope as::
        
        bin/debug-instance fg
        
And your main Zope instance stays in production mode::

        bin/instance 
        
.. note ::

        Using fg switch foces Zope always into debug mode, but does not concern log level.
