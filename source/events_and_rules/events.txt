Events

This document briefly discuss about doing event handling using zope.event module.
Zope component architecture's 'zope.event package <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.event>' is
used to manage subscribeable events in Plone.


Introduction
------------

There are few notable characters in Plone event system

* It is simple

* Subscriber calling order is not modifiable - you cannot set the order how the event handlers are called

* Event cannot be cancelled - all handlers will get the event always

* Event handlers cannot have return values 

* Exceptions raised from an event handler will interrupt the request processing

Registering event handler
-------------------------

Subscribing in ZCML
===================

Custom event example::

   <subscriber
     for=".interfaces.IMyObject
          .interfaces.IMyEvent"
     handler=".content.MyObject.myEventHandler"
     />

Life cycle events example::

   <subscriber
     zcml:condition="installed zope.lifecycleevent"
     for=".interfaces.ISitsPatient
          zope.lifecycleevent.IObjectModifiedEvent"
     handler=".content.SitsPatient.objectModified"
     />


Subscribing in Python
=====================

The following subscription is valid through the process life cycle. In unit tests,
it is important to clear test event handlers between the test steps.

Example::

    import zope.component

    def my_event_handler(context, event):
        """
        @param context: Zope object for which the event was fired for. Usually this is Plone content object.

        @param event: Subclass of event.
        """
        pass

    gsm = zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager()
    gsm.registerHandler(my_event_handler, (IMyObject,IMyEvent))
    
Firing an event
---------------

Use zope.event.notify() to fire event objects to their subscribers.

Example how to fire an event in unit tests::

        import zope.event
        from plone.postpublicationhook.event import AfterPublicationEvent
                
        event = AfterPublicationEvent(self.portal, self.portal.REQUEST)
        zope.event.notify(event)

Event types
-----------

Modified events
===============

Two different content event types are available and might work differently depending on your scenario

* Products.Archetypes.interfaces.IObjectEditedEvent - called for Archetypes object which are not
  anymore in the creation stage

* zope.lifecycleevent.IObjectModifiedEvent - called for creation stage events too

Delete events
==============

Delete events can be fired several times for the same object. 
Some delete event transactions are rolled back.

* `Read more about Delete events in this discussion <http://n2.nabble.com/Event-on-object-deletion-tp3670562p3670562.html>`_.


invokeFactory and events
========================

When using invokeFactory, event such as ObjectInitializedEvent is not
triggered. `Read more
