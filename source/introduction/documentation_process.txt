Documentation oriented problem solving approach
-----------------------------------------------

In some point, you will encounter information which is missing here but you think it shoud
be here. If you manage to solve your problem we'd like to have few lines written about
it how did you solve it, so that other can benefit from your hard work. Also,
this documentation will serve as your memo when you'll face the same problem
again after longer period of time.

This process is called documentation oriented problem solving.
Its goal is to avoid the need to resolve the same problem twice.
