Documentation process
======================

This documentation is written and maintained by volunteering experts.
It is incomplete due to constant change in the surrounding projects.
To keep up with the change we hope you can help us to improve the documentation
and contribute to this documentation.

Documentation oriented problem solving approach
-----------------------------------------------

In some point, you will encounter information which is missing here but you think it shoud
be here. If you manage to solve your problem we'd like to have few lines written about
it how did you solve it, so that other can benefit from your hard work. Also,
this documentation will serve as your memo when you'll face the same problem
again after longer period of time.

This process is called documentation oriented problem solving.
Its goal is to avoid the need to resolve the same problem twice.

To contribute this documentation you can

1) Ask permission to edit this document directly (plone.org account needed)

2) Use "Add comment" feature at the bottom of the page. Note that this feature is not support
   forum and it is not always likely anyone will give answers to your questions.

3) Open a new ticket (plone.org account needed) in `Plone bug tracker <https://dev.plone.org/plone>`_.
   Use component ''documentation'' and use summary "Contribution to developer documentation".

4) Send email to `Plone documentation team email list <http://plone.org/support/forums/docs>`_ (subscription needed)
