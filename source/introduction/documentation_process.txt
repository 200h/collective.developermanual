This documentation is written and maintained by volunteering experts.
It is incomplete due to constant change in the surrounding projects.
To keep up with the change we hope you can help us to improve the documentation
and contribute to this documentation.

Documentation oriented problem solving approach
-----------------------------------------------

At some point, you will encounter information which is missing here but you think it shoud
be here. If you manage to solve your problem we'd like to have a few lines written about
how you solved it so that others can benefit from your hard work. Also,
this documentation will serve as your memo when you face the same problem
some time in the future.

This process is called "documentation oriented problem solving".
Its goal is to avoid the need to resolve the same problem twice.
