        How to write and submit content for the Plone Developer
        Documentation.

Introduction
============

This chapter explains the basics of editing, updating
and contributing to Plone Developer Documentation.

Contributions needed
====================

Below is the list of documentation and references we'd like to see:

- New code snippets and system descriptions 
- Links to external documentation 
- Links to component READMEs 
- Links to blog posts talking about particular issues
- Links to email list discussions 
- Links to source code (directly to the version control)
- Clean up and restructuring

Committing changes to the documentation Github
============================================================

* You can 
  `commit file edits through GitHub web interface <https://github.com/collective/collective.developermanual>`_
  using **Fork and Edit** button 


* Alternative, clone the repository using *git*, perform changes and push them back

Plone collective GitHub repository has open-for-all contribution access.
If you want to contribute changes without asking the maintainers
to merge them, please add your GitHub username to your profile on plone.org and 
request access `here <http://dev.plone.org/wiki/ContributeCollective>`_.  

Using git
-----------

This is the recommended method. Please do not be afraid to commit.
If you break the documentation or add invalid information,
it will be cleaned up sooner or later and no one is going to blame you:
human errors happen all the time.

* Learn about `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ and `restructured text <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_.

* Get the documentation source files::

    git clone https://github.com/collective/collective.developermanual

* Edit the file which you want to update.

* Run buildout (or just bin/develop update) to get latest documentation include the code

* Check that Sphinx building does not give warnings::

    bin/sphinx-build source build

* Commit changes::

    git commit -m "My message what I changed"
    git push


Document page format
====================

Here are some Sphinx coding conventions used in the documentation.

Page structure
--------------

Each page must contain, in this order:

* The main heading. This will be visible in the table of contents::

        ==================================
        Writing and updating this document
        ==================================

* The description of the page, which will appear in Plone's
  *Description* Dublin Core metadata field. This created using the reST
  *admonition* directive. A single paragraph of text consisting of 1-3
  sentences is recommended, so that the same text fits into the search
  engine results (Google)::

        .. admonition:: Description

                This text will go to Plone's pages description field. It will
                appear in the search engine listings for the page.

The *contents* directive will cause Sphinx to generate the *Table of
Contents* shortcut links at the start of the page.  Using the *local*
option excludes the page itself and ToC title from the listing::

        .. contents :: :local:

Introduction paragraph: A brief overview::

A number of paragraphs: The actual content of the document page::

        Contributions needed
        --------------------

        Below is the list of documentation and references we'd like to see

Section structure
=================

Each section (folder) must contain

* ``index.txt`` with:

    * Section heading: This will be visible in the table of contents
    * A single paragraph summarizing what this section is all about. This will
      be mapped to Plone folder description.
    * Sphinx toctree directive, maxdepth 2. Each ``.txt`` file in the folder should
      be linked to this toctree.


Syntax highlighting
-------------------

Sphinx does syntax highlighting using the `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ library.

You can specify different highlighting for a code block using the following syntax::

    With two colons you start a code block using the default highlighter::

        # Some Python code here
        # The language defaults to Python, we don't need to set it
        if 1 == 2:
            pass


You can specify the language used for syntax highlighting by using ``code-block``::

    .. code-block:: python

        if "foo" == "bar":
            # This is Python code
            pass

For example, to specify XML::

    .. code-block:: xml

        <somesnippet>Some XML</somesnippet>

... or UNIX shell::

    .. code-block:: console

        # A comment
        sh myscript.sh

Setting the highlighting mode for the whole document::

    .. highlight:: console

     All code blocks in this doc use console highlighting by default::

            some shell commands


If syntax highlighting is not enabled for your code block, you probably have a
syntax error and Pygments will fail silently.

Other Sphinx and restructured text source snippets
----------------------------------------------------

Italics::

    This *word* is italics.

Strong::

    This **word** is in bold text.

Inline code highlighting::

    This is ``aFunction()``

Making an external link (note the underscore at the end)::

    `This is an external link to <http://opensourcehacker.com>`_

Making an internal link::

    :doc:`This is a link to </introduction/writing.txt>`

Bullet list::

    * First bullet

    * Second bullet with `a link <http://opensourcehacker.com>`_

Warning::

    .. warning ::

        This is a warning box (red)

Note::

    .. note ::
    
        This is a note box (yellow)        

Code documentation
==================

For certain kinds of documentation it is better to write the documentation in parts
of the plone core code base. This can be done using the autodoc sphinx extension.

... to include a module docstring ::

 .. automodule:: plone.app.contentrules.exportimport

... to include a class docstring ::

 .. autoclass:: Products.CMFEditions.exportimport.repository.RepositoryToolXMLAdapter

... or to include both a module and class docstrings ::

 .. automodule:: Products.CMFEditions.exportimport.repository
   :members: RepositoryToolXMLAdapter

Not all documentation is best kept with the code. You should use autodoc
if:

- the documentation is reasonably self-contained and relates just to
  that module;
- it's mainly reference material, rather than tutorial-style documentation;
- you think it's more likely to be maintained by the code authors.

Once you write code documentation:

1. find an appropriate place in this manual to place it. Make sure it flows
   and makes when sense read with the documentation around it;
#. include a comment in the docstring mentioning its use in this manual so
   those editing the code can test the manual if changes are made;
#. add the module to the autocheckout value in the manual's ``buildout.cfg``.
