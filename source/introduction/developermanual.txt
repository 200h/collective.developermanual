Introduction
--------------

This concerns only those who

* Wish to generate HTML version of this documentation

* Wish to upload a revised version of this documentation to plone.org

The documentation is in Sphinx format.
Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.

Setting up software
-------------------

First you need to install Git for your operating system::

        sudo apt-get install git-core
        
or::

        sudo port install git-code

.. note:::

        You must not have Sphinx installed in your Python environment (easy_install).
        Remove it, as it will clash with the version created by buildout.
        Use virtualenv if you need to have Sphinx around for other projects.
                
Run buildout to install Sphinx and funnelweb::

        # Note: You must use Python 2.4 here
        python2.4 bootstrap.py
        bin/buildout
        
This will always result to error, but bin/ folder is populated with required scripts.
Now you need to checkout all the source code using Mr. Developer tool::

        bin/develop co ""

Run buildout again::

        bin/buildout

Building static HTML with Sphinx
---------------------------------

This creates *docs/html* folder from *source* folder by compiling all collective.developermanual pages,
using sphinx-build command from buildout::

        cd docs
        make html 

Uploading documentation to a site
---------------------------------

Funnelweb is a tool which read HTML, transforms it and uploads it to another site.

Example how to upload to a local Plone instance::

        bin/toplone http://localhost:5011/foobar/knowledge-base/test/
        
First Funnelweb fill crawl through generated *docs/html* Sphinx documentation
(this takes up to 30 seconds).

        
Setting up Plone for upload
----------------------------

The documentation can be uploaded to

* Plone site

* `Plone Help Center add-on <http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter>`_ installed

* Sphinx CSS installed
