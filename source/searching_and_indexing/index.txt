Searching and indexing
==========================

By default, Plone uses ZODB da    ase which querying and indexing facilities are
provided by cataloging service.

* Indexing: Each time object is modified, all searchable data is copied to the catalog

# Querying: Search keys are matched against the indexed catalog copies. When there is a search
  hit the actual object is not returned, but a copy of indexed data called *brain*
