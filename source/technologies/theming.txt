Theming
=======

To understand Plone's theming story you must first understand the technology
stack on which it is built. 

Zope2
-----

*Old style*

Zope2 is the oldest portion of the stack. It offered technologies like
``Acquisition`` (among others) which facilitated the reuse of objects 
such as page templates amongst a website full of "content" objects.

CMF
---

*Old style*

Then came The Zope ``CMF`` (content management framework) which offered
concepts like file system directory views (FSDV) and skin layers (among
others). The CMF allowed people to manage their website's CSS, JavaScript and
image resources on the filesystem, typically inside a "skins" directory.

ZTK
---

*New style*

Initially called Zope 3 (more or less), the ``ZTK`` (Zope Toolkit) is a set of
reusable packages (including zope.component and zope.interface which provide the
Zope Component Architecture) that bring a modern, scalable development
environment to Plone.

Diazo
-----

*New style*

Born out of a desire to separate Python package code from website resources
like CSS, JavaScript and images; Diazo (orginally called XDV) is a technology
that maps Plone content to an XHTML template, based on an XML ruleset.
