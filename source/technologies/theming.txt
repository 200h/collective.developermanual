Theming
=======

To understand Plone's theming story you must first understand the technology
stack on which it is built. 

Zope2
-----

**Old style**

Zope2 is the oldest portion of the stack. It offered the technology of
Acquisition (among others) which facilitated the reuse of objects such as page
templates, amongst a website full of "content" objects.

CMF
---

**Old style**

Then along came the Zope CMF (content management framework) which offered
the concepts of file system directory views (FSDV) and skin layers (among
others). The CMF allowed people to manage their website's CSS and Javascript
resources on the filesystem, typically inside a "skins" directory.

ZTK
---

**New style**

Initially called Zope 3 (more or less), the ZTK (Zope Toolkit) is a set of
reusable packages (including zope.component and zope.interface which provide the
Zope Component Architecture) that bring a modern, scalable development
environment to Plone.

Diazo
-----

**New style**

Born out of the desire to separate code from website resources, Diazo
(orginally called XDV) is a technology that maps Plone content to an XHTML
template based on an XML ruleset.
