=====================
Serving HTTP traffic
=====================

Serving content from your site to your users is effectively a mechanism to translate
HTTP requests to HTTP responses.

In Plone, answering to HTTP requests can be divided to three subproblems

* Managing HTTP request and response pair lifecycle

* Traversing the request to the target object by its URI

* Choosing different parts of the code depending on active layers

Plone (ZMedusa server) also supports FTP and WebDAV protocols.
