HTTP request and response
=========================

.. admonition:: Description

        Accessing and manipulating Zope's HTTP request and response objects programmatically. 

.. contents :: :local:

Introduction
------------

This chapter explains the basics of Zope HTTP requests and responses

* Request and response objects lifecycle

* Data which can be extracted from the request

* Data which can be placed on the response

Lifecycle
---------

Unlike in some other web frameworks, in Plone you do not explictly create or return HTTP response objects.
A HTTP request object always has a HTTP response object associated with it and the response object is created
when the request hits the web server.

The response is available for the whole lifetime of request processing.
This effectively allows you to set and modify response headers in any point of code.

Web servers
-----------

Usually Plone runs on Zope's ZServer_ (also known as Medusa). Other
alternatives are WSGI_ compatible web servers like Repoze_.

The web server may affect how your HTTP objects are constructed.

HTTP Request
------------

All incoming HTTP requests are wrapped to (Zope) ZPublisher_ HTTPRequest_ objects.

Usually your view function or instance will receive an HTTP request object, along with a traversed context, as its construction parameter.

You can access the request in your view::

    from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

    class SampleView(BrowserView):

        def __init__(context, request):
            # Each view instance receives context and request as construction parameters
            self.context = context
            self.request = request

        def __call__(self):
            # Entry point of request processing
            # Dump out incoming request variables
            print self.request.items()

Request method
==============

Request method (GET or POST) can be read::

  request["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST" # or "GET"


Request URL
===========

To get the asked URL:

    >>> request["ACTUAL_URL"]
    'http://localhost:8080/site'

To get the URL of the served object use the following. This might be
different from the asked URL, since Plone does all kinds of default page and default view magic.

    >>> request["URL"]
    'http://m.localhost:8080/site/matkailijallefolder/@@frontpage'

.. note ::

        URLs, as accessed above, do not contain query string. 

Query string
============

Unparsed query string can be accessed.

E.g. if you go to http://localhost:8080/site?something=foobar::

    >>> self.request["QUERY_STRING"]
   'something=foobar'        
   
.. note ::

        You can use request.form dictionary to access parsed query string content.   
        
Request path
============

The request URI path can be read from request.path. request.path is a list of path components.
request.path is a virtual path and has the site id component removed from it.

Example::

    reconstructed_path = "/".join(request.path) # will be

Other possible headers::

    ('PATH_INFO', '/plonecommunity/Members')
    ('PATH_TRANSLATED', '/plonecommunity/Members')

    
REQUEST_URI
===========    

To get the variable which corresponds to REQUEST_URI in PHP the following helps::

    # Concatenate the user visible URL and query parameters    
    full_url = request.ACTUAL_URL + "?" + request.QUERY_STRING
    parsed = urlparse.urlsplit(full_url)
        
    # Extract path part and add the query if it existed
    uri = parsed[2]
    if parsed[3]:
        uri += "?" + parsed[3]

Request client IP
===================

Example::

        def get_ip(request):
            """  Extract the client IP address from the HTTP request in proxy compatible way.
            
            @return: IP address as a string or None if not available
            """
            if "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR" in request.environ:
                # Virtual host
                ip = request.environ["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"]
            elif "HTTP_HOST" in request.environ:
                # Non-virtualhost
                ip = request.environ["REMOTE_ADDR"]
            else:
                # Unit test code?
                ip = None
                
            return ip

* http://wiki.zope.org/zope2/ZopeAndApache#setting-remote-addr-to-the-client-ip

GET variables
=============

HTTP GET variables are available in request.form if REQUEST_METHOD was GET.

Example::


    # http://yoursite.com/@@testview/?my_param_id=something
    print self.request.form["my_param_id"]

POST variables
==============

HTTP POST varibles are available in stored request.form dictionary::

    print request.form.items() # Everything POST brought to us

There is no difference in accessing GET and POST variables.

HTTP headers
============

HTTP headers are available through request.get_header() and request.environ dictionary.

Example::

    referer = self.request.get_header("referer") # Page referer (the page from user came from)

    if referer == None: # referer will be none if it was missing
        pass

Dumping all headers::

    for name, value in request.environ.items():
        print "%s: %s" % (name, value)

Query string
============

To access raw HTTP GET query string::

    query_string = request["QUERY_STRING"]
    
    
Web environment
===============

The web server exposes its own environment variables in request.other (ZServer_) or request.environ (Repoze_ and other WSGI_ based web servers)::

    print request.other.items()

    user_agent = request.other["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]

    user_agent = request.environ["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] # WSGI or Repoze server

Host name
=========

Below is an example to get the HTTP server name in a safe manner regarding virtual hosts.

.. code-block:: python

    def get_host_name(request):
        """ Extract host name in virtual host safe manner

        @param request: HTTPRequest object, assumed contains environ dictionary

        @return: Host DNS name, as requested by client. Lowercased, no port part.
                 Return None if host name is not present in HTTP request headers
                 (e.g. unit testing).
        """

        if "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST" in request.environ:
            # Virtual host
            host = request.environ["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST"]
        elif "HTTP_HOST" in request.environ:
            # Direct client request
            host = request.environ["HTTP_HOST"]
        else:
            return None

        # separate to domain name and port sections        
        host=host.split(":")[0].lower()

        return host


Flat access
===========

GET, POST and web environment variables are flat mapped
to the request object as a dictionary look up::

    # Comes from POST
    request["input_username"] == request.form["input_username"]

    # Comes from environ
    request.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT') == request.environ["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]

Request mutability
==================

Even if you can write and add your own variables to HTTP request objects
this behavior is discouraged. If you need to create cache variables for
request lifecycle use annotations_. '''TODO: Add link to internal
annotations examples when written'''

Accessing HTTP request outside context
---------------------------------------

There are often cases where you would like to get hold of HTTP request object,
but the underlying framework does not pass it to you.
In these cases you have two ways to access the request object

* Use acquisition to get the request object from the site root. When Plone site traversing
  starts, the HTTP request is put to magical site.REQUEST variable.

* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/five.globalrequest  

Example of getting HTTP request using acquisition::

        # context is any traversed Plone content item 
        request = getattr(context, "REQUEST", None)
        if request is not None:
                # Do the normal flow
                pass
        else:
                # This code path was not initiated by an incoming web server request
                # Handle cases like
                # - command line scripts
                # - add-on installer
                # - code called during Zope start up
                # -etc.
                pass
        
        
HTTP response
-------------

Usually you do not return HTTP responses directly from your views. Instead, you modify the existing HTTP response object (associated with the request) and return the object which will be HTTP response payload.

Returned payload object can be

* String (str) 8-bit raw data

* Iterable - the response is streamed instead of memory buffered

Accessing response
==================

You can access to HTTP response if you know the request::

    from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

    class SampleView(BrowserView):

        def __init__(context, request):
            # Each view instance receives context and request as construction parameters
            self.context = context
            self.request = request

        def __call__(self):
            response = self.request.response
            return "<html><body>Hello world!</body></html>"

Response headers
==========================

Use HTTPResponse_ setHeader() to set headers::

     # Response dynamically generated image
     self.request.response.setHeader("Content-type", "image/jpeg")
     return image_data
     
     
Content disposition
===================

Content disposition header is used to set the filename of download.
It is also used by Flash 10 to check whether Flash download is valid.

Example how to force download and downloadable filename::

        response = self.request.response
        response.setHeader("Content-type", "text/x-vCard; charset=utf-8")        
        response.setHeader("Content-Transfer-Encoding", "8bit")
        
        cd = 'attachment; filename=%s.vcf' % (context.id)
        response.setHeader('Content-Disposition', cd)

Return code
===========

Use HTTPResponse.setStatus(self, status, reason=None, lock=None)
to set HTTP return status (404 Not Found, 500 Internal error, etc.).

If lock=True the further modifications of HTTPResponse are prevented
and will result to silent failure.

Response body
=====================

You might want to read or manipualte response body
in post-publication hook.

Response body may not be string or basestring:
it might be generator or iterable for blob data.

Body is avaialble is response.body attribute.

Redirects
================

Use response.redirect() method::

        # This will do 302 Temporary Redirect 
        response.redirect(new_url)
        
        # This will do 301 Permantent Redirect 
        response.redirect(new_url, status=301)
        

Middleware-like hooks
---------------------

Plone does not have a middleware concept, as everything happens through traversing.
Middleware behavior can be emulated with *before traverse* hook.
Before traverse hook can be installed on any persistent object in the
traversing graph. The hook is persistent, so it is a database change
and must be installed using custom GenericSetup Python code.

.. warning::

    Before traverse hooks cannot create new HTTP response or return alternative HTTP response.
    Only exception-like HTTP response modification is supported,
    like HTTP redirects. If you need to rewrite the whole response,
    post-publication hook must be used.

Examples

* Redirector: https://plonegomobile.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gomobile/gomobile.mobile/gomobile/mobile/postpublication.py


Post-publication hook
---------------------

Post publication hook is run when

* After the context object has been traversed

* After the view has been called and the view has rendered the response

* Before response is sent to browser

* Before transaction is committed

This is practical for caching purposes: it is the ideal place to determine and insert caching headers into the response.

Extracting useful information in the post-publication hook
==============================================================

Example::

        from zope.component import adapter, getUtility, getMultiAdapter
        from plone.postpublicationhook.interfaces import IAfterPublicationEvent        

        from Products.CMFCore.interfaces import IContentish

        def get_contentish(object):
            """
            Traverse acquisition upwards until we get contentish object used for the HTTP response.
            """
        
            contentish = object
            while not IContentish.providedBy(contentish):
                
                if hasattr(contentish, "aq_parent"):        
                    contentish = contentish.aq_parent
                else:
                    break
                
            return contentish


        # This must be refered in configure.zcml
        @adapter(Interface, IAfterPublicationEvent)
        def language_fixer(object, event):
            """ Redirect mobile users to mobile site using gomobile.mobile.interfaces.IRedirector.
        
            Note: Plone does not provide a good hook doing this before traversing, so we must
            do it in post-publication. This adds extra latency, but is doable.
            """
        
            request = event.request
            response = request.response
            
            # object can be a page template, view, whichever happens to be at the very end of traversed acquisition chain
            context = get_contentish(object)
