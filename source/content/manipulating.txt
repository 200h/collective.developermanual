Manipulating objects
=======================

Manipulating objects depends on whether they are Archetypes subsystem based or
Dexterity subsystem based.

For more information, consult the subsystem manual.

* `Archetypes examples <http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/manipulating-plone-objects-programmatically/reading-and-writing-field-values>`_.

* See 'Manipulating Content Objects <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/reference/manipulating-content-objects>`_
  in Dexterity manul

Reindexing modified objects
---------------------------

After modifying the object, you need to reindex it to portal_catalog to update the search and listing information.

For more information, see :doc:`\** How to update this document </searching_and_indexing/indexing>`.
