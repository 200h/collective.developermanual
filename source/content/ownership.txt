.. admonition:: Description

        Programmatically manipulate Plone content item's ownership

Introduction
------------

Each content item has an owner user.

Owned item instances are of subclass of AccessControl.Owned

* http://svn.zope.org/Zope/trunk/src/AccessControl/Owned.py?rev=96262&view=auto

Getting the owner of the item
-----------------------------

Example::

        # Returns PropertiedUser for Zope admin
        # Returns PloneUser for normal users object
        context.getOwner()
        
Changing ownership of content
-------------------------------

You can use AccessControl.Owner.changeOwnership::

        changeOwnership(self, user, recursive=0)

User is PropertiedUser object.

Example::

    # Get the user handle from member data object
    user = member.getUser()
    
    # Make the member owner of his home folder
    home_folder.changeOwnership(user, recursive=False)
    home_folder.reindexObjectSecurity()

.. warning ::

        Could not get this to work. Use local roles instead.
        
Example how to add ownership for additional user using local roles::

    home_folder.manage_setLocalRoles(username, ["Owner",])
    home_folder.reindexObjectSecurity()
