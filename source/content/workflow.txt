        Programming workflows in Plone.

Introduction
-------------

The DCWorkflow product manages the default Plone workflow system.

A workflow state is not directly stored on the object. Instead, a separate
portal_workflow tool must be used to access a workflow state. Workflow look-ups
involve an extra database fetch.

For more information, see

Creating workflows
------------------

The recommended method is to use the portal_workflow user interface in the Zope Management Interface
to construct the workflow through-the-web and then you can export it using GenericSetup's portal_setup tool.

Include necessary parts from exported workflows.xml and workflows folder in your add-on product
GenericSetup profile (add-on folder profiles/default).

Assigning the workflow to a particular content type
-----------------------------------------------------

This is done by workflows.xml. You can edit it online in portal_workflows in Zope Management Interface.

Getting the current workflow state
-----------------------------------

Example::

    workflowTool = getToolByName(self.portal, "portal_workflow")
    # Returns workflow state object
    status = workflowTool.getStatusOf("plone_workflow", object)
    # Plone workflows use variable called "review_state" to store state id
    # of the object state
    state = status["review_state"]
    assert state == "published", "Got state:" + str(state)

Changing workflow state
-----------------------

You cannot directly set the workflow to any state, but you must push
it through legal state transitions.

**Security warning**: Workflows may have security assertations which are bypassed by admin user.
Always test your workflow methods using a normal user.

In Python code
================

Example::

        from Products.CMFCore.WorkflowCore import WorkflowException
        
        portal.invokeFactory("SampleContent", id="sampleProperty")

        workflowTool = getToolByName(context, "portal_workflow")
        try:
            workflowTool.doActionFor(portal.sampleProperty, "submit")
        except WorkflowException:
            # a workflow exception is risen if the state transition is not available
            # (the sampleProperty content is in a workflow state which
            # does not have a "submit" transition)
            pass

Via HTTP
========

Plone provides a ``workflow_action`` script which is able to trigger the status
modification through an HTTP request (browser address bar).

Example::

	http://localhost:9020/site/page/content_status_modify?workflow_action=publish

Gets the list of ids of all installed workflows
------------------------------------------------

Useful to test if a particular workflow is installed::

  # Get all site workflows
  ids = workflowTool.getWorkflowIds()
  self.failUnless("link_workflow" in ids, "Had workflows " + str(ids))

Getting default workflow for a portal type
------------------------------------------

Get default workflow for the type::

 chain = workflowTool.getChainForPortalType(ExpensiveLink.portal_type)
 self.failUnless(chain == ("link_workflow",), "Had workflow chain" + str(chain))

Getting workflows for an object
-------------------------------

How to test which workflow the object has::

    # See that we have a right workflow in place
    workflowTool = getToolByName(context, "portal_workflow")
    # Returns tuple of all workflows assigned for a context object
    chain = workflowTool.getChainFor(context)

    # there must be only one workflow for our object
    self.failUnless(len(chain) == 1)

    # this must must be the workflow name
    self.failUnless(chain[0] == 'link_workflow', "Had workflow " + str(chain[0]))

Disabling workflow for a content type
---------------------------------------

If a content type doesn't have a workflow it uses its parent container security settings.
By default, content types Image and File have no workflow.

Workflows can be disabled by setting the workflow setting empty in portal_workflow in ZMI.

Example how to do it with GenericSetup *workflows.xml*

.. code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <object name="portal_workflow" meta_type="Plone Workflow Tool">
         <property
            name="title">Contains workflow definitions for your portal</property>
         <bindings>
          <!-- Bind nothing for these content types -->
          <type type_id="Image"/>
          <type type_id="File"/>
         </bindings>
        </object>
