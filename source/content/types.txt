=================
Type information
=================

Plone maintains available content types in portal_types tool.

portal_types is a folderish content where type information are child objects,
keyed by portal_type metadata.

`TypesTool source code <http://svn.zope.org/Products.CMFCore/trunk/Products/CMFCore/TypesTool.py?rev=101748&view=auto>`_.


Registering a new type
----------------------

Use paster addcontent template to create new types. Creating types by hand is not worth of the problems.

If you still try to create types by hand and something goes wrong please read
`Why doesn't my custom content type show up in add menu <http://plone.org/documentation/faq/why-doesnt-my-custom-content-type-show-up-in-add-menu/>`_
checklist.

Implictly allowed
------------------

Implictly allowed is flag whether the content is globally addable or
must be specifically enabled for certain folders.

The following example allows creation of Large Plone Folder anywhere at the site
(it is disabled by default). For available properties, see TypesTool._advanced_properties.

Example::

    portal_types = self.context.portal_types
    lpf = portal_types["Large Plone Folder"]
    lpf.global_allow = True # This is "Globally allowed" property
