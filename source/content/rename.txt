Renaming objects
----------------

OFS interface has facilities to rename objects

* http://svn.zope.org/Zope/trunk/src/OFS/interfaces.py?rev=105745&view=auto

* manage_renameObject(oldid, newid) for one item

* manage_renameObject([oldid, oldid2], [newid, newid2]) for rename many items

* Products.CMFPlone.PloneFolder overrides manage_renameObject() to have hooks
  to reindex the new object path

Example how to rename object id to have *-old* suffix::

        id = lc.getId()
        parent = lc.aq_parent
        parent.manage_renameObject(id, id + "-old")
