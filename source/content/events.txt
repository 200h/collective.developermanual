        Programming events with Plone
        
.. contents:: local

Introduction
------------

Plone supports events as the content. Events have start time, end time
and etc. fields. Events can be exported in standard vCal (Outlook)
and iCal (OSX) formats. A default calendar shows published events
in a calendar view.

.. note::

        Recurring events (events repeating with an interval)
        are not supported out-of-the-box on Plone 4.0 or older.
