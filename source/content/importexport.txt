        Importing and exporting content between Plone sites and other CMS sysstems

.. contents :: local

Introduction
------------

Goal: you want to import and export content between Plone sites.

* If both sites have identical version and add-on product configuration you can use Zope Management Interface export/import

* If they don't and you e.g. have different Plone version on source and target site, you need to use add-on product like `quintagroup.transmogrifier <http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/quintagroup.transmogrifier>`_

quintagroup.transmogrifier
--------------------------

`quintagroup.transmogrifier <http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/quintagroup.transmogrifier>`_ is an add-on product which provides Plone adminstrator user interface for
exporting and importing content.

Internally, it uses `collective.transmogrifier <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transmogrifier>`_ package which itself does not provide any kind of user interface.

Exporting single folder only
============================

You can limit export step to with arbitary :doc:`portal_catalog </searching_and_indexing/query>` conditions.
