 Import and export

.. admonition:: Description

        Importing and exporting content between Plone sites and other CMS sysstems

.. contents :: local

Introduction
------------

Goal: you want to import and export content between Plone sites.

* If both sites have identical version and add-on product configuration you can use Zope Management Interface export/import

* If they don't and you e.g. have different Plone version on source and target site, you need to use add-on product like `quintagroup.transmogrifier <http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/quintagroup.transmogrifier>`_

quintagroup.transmogrifier
--------------------------

`quintagroup.transmogrifier <http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/quintagroup.transmogrifier>`_ is an add-on product which provides Plone adminstrator user interface for
exporting and importing content.

Internally, it uses `collective.transmogrifier <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transmogrifier>`_ package which itself does not provide any kind of user interface.

Exporting single folder only
============================

You can limit export step to with arbitary :doc:`portal_catalog </searching_and_indexing/query>` conditions.

The recipe described here assumes the exported and imported site have the same path for the folder.
Manually rename or move the folder on source or target to change its location.

.. note ::

        This recipe requires quintagroup.transmogrify 0.4 or later.

Source site
+++++++++++

Install ``quintagroup.transmogrifier`` via buildout and Plone add-on control panel.

Go to *Site setup* > *Content migration*.

Edit export settings. Remove unnecessary pipeline entries by looking the example below. Add a new ``catalogsource`` blueprint::
    
        [transmogrifier]
        pipeline =
            catalogsource
            fileexporter
            marshaller
            datacorrector
            writer
            EXPORTING
        
        [catalogsource]
        blueprint = quintagroup.transmogrifier.catalogsource
        path = query= /isleofback/ohjeet
        
Also the following bit must be changed, because the target site does not necessary
have the same content types available as the source site and this may prevent
setting up folderish content settings::

        [marshaller]
        blueprint = quintagroup.transmogrifier.marshaller
        exclude = 
          immediatelyAddableTypes
          locallyAllowedTypes
            
You might want to remove other, unneeded blueprints from the export ``pipeline``.
For example, ``portletexporter`` may cause problems if the source and target site
do not have the same portlet code.
        
Go to *Zope Management Interface* > *portal_setup* > *Export* tab. Check Content (transmogrifier) step.
Press *Export Selected Steps* at the bottom of the page. Now a .tar.gz file will be downloaded.    

During the export process ``instance.log`` file is updated with status info. You might want to follow
it in real-time from UNIX command line

.. code-block:: console

        tail -f var/log/instance.log 

In log you should see entries running like::

        2010-12-27 12:05:30 INFO EXPORTING _path=sisalto/ohjeet/yritys/yritysten-tuotetiedot/tuotekortti
        2010-12-27 12:05:30 INFO EXPORTING 
        Pipeline processing time: 00:00:02
                  94 items were generated in source sections
                  94 went through full pipeline
                   0 were discarded in some section

Target site
+++++++++++

Install ``quintagroup.transmogrifier`` via buildout and Plone add-on control panel.

Open target site ``instance.log`` file for monitoring the import process

.. code-block:: console

        tail -f var/log/instance.log 


Go to *Zope Management Interface* > *portal_setup* > *Import* tab. 

Choose downloaded ``setup_toolxxx.tar.gz`` file at the bottom of the page,
for *Import uploaded tarball* input.

Run import and monitoring log file for possible errors. Note that the import
completes even if the target site would not able to process incoming content.
If there is a serious problem the import seems to complete succesfully,
but no content is created.
