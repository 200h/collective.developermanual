=======================
 Zope DateTime
=======================

Some Plone dates are stored as Zope DateTime objects.
This is different from standard Python datetime (notice the letter casing).
Zope DateTime predates Python datetime which was added in Python 2.4.
Zope DateTime is old code, so do rites necessary
for your religion before programming with it.

.. note::

	Using Python datetime is recommended if possible.
	Zope DateTime should be dealt in legacy systems only.
