 Paster templates
===========================

.. admonition:: Description

	How to create Paster code skeleton templates to easily add your 
	own add-on product types or code inside your add-on porduct.
	
Introduction
------------

Plone CMS and Python extensively use :doc:`paster code templating system </tutorials/paste>`
to aid add-on product development.

Paster allows you to create code from code skeleton templates,
automatically filling in your company name etc.

Default Plone templates are in `ZopeSkel <http://plone.org/products/zopeskel>`_ package.

* This document tells how to create your own paster templates

* For information how to use paster please refer to :doc:`paster section in tutorials </tutorials/paste>`

Extending ZopeSkel	 
------------------

First you need to create a Python egg where your templates will be contained.
We use ZopeSkel's *plone* template, but generic Python template should do as well.

	paster create -t plone gomobile.templates

.. note ::

	You do not need tests.py or configure.zcml files in the template package itself.
	
setup.py entries
================	
	
Then we edit ``setup.py`` and add paster template entry points::

	  install_requires=[
          'setuptools',
          'PasteScript',
          'ZopeSkel',
          # -*- Extra requirements: -*-
      ],
		 
	  entry_points="""

      # These will declare what templates paster create command can find
      # -*- Entry points: -*-
      [paste.paster_create_template]
      dexterity = gomobile.templates.theme:Theme
      """,
      
You could also have "subtemplates" with local paster commands which add more code 
into existing code skeletons::

      [zopeskel.zopeskel_sub_template]
      dexterity_content = collective.dexteritypaste.localcommands.dexterity:DexterityContent
      dexterity_behavior = collective.dexteritypaste.localcommands.dexterity:DexterityBehavior
      dexterity_view = collective.dexteritypaste.localcommands.dexterity:DexterityView
      
Entry points
+++++++++++++

Entrypoints allow different plug-in systems through using the standard Python eggs and ``setup.py`` file.
Plone 3.3+ picks Plone add-ons through this way and ``paster`` command pick available templates
from all available eggs this way.

Template class
==============      

Paster template is defined with a class referred from the entry point. 
Here is an example how we extend the existing Plone template class::

Asking template input
=====================

*ZopeSkel* contains facilities how to ask template input from the user who is running Paster.
It provides some sane way to give defaults and validate the input.

Examples

* http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk/zopeskel/abstract_buildout.py

.. note ::

	ZopeSkel input definitions should work both on command line and on the web based generator.
	
Pre- and postcondition triggers
===============================

If you want to run special code before the templates are run and after they have succesfully 
complete, ZopeSkel provides some logic for this.

Examples

* http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk/zopeskel/hosting.py 

Template folder structure
=========================

All templates should go to ``templates`` folder in your ZopeSkel extension namespace.

Filenames and folder names can contain variable substitues as::

	templates/yourtemplatename/+namespace_package+/
	
will be mapped to::

	yourcompany.package/yourcompany/ 		
	
Template files
==============

Files having special ``_tmpl`` extension will have string substitution performed on then.

Example:

* http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.dexteritypaste/trunk/collective/dexteritypaste/templates/dexterity/setup.py_tmpl	

The best way to get the initial template files and folders for your add-on template is to
checkout some existing ZopeSkel package, like *collective.dexteritypaste* and export its 
*templates* folder to your own add-on template.

.. note ::

        As writing of this I am not aware of any meta-template to create paster templates.
        But should thing would be greatly beneficial.
        
Local commands
==============

Local commands define insert snippets which will be injected to the existing files.

The marker for snippet injects is::

	  -*- extra stuff goes here -*- 
	  
You need to put it to the comment format of the file type. Example for XML would be::

  	  <!-- -*- extra stuff goes here -*- --> 	  

Some examples

* http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.dexteritypaste/trunk/collective/dexteritypaste/templates/dexterity/+namespace_package+/+package+/configure.zcml_tmpl

* http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.dexteritypaste/trunk/collective/dexteritypaste/localcommands/templates/dexterity/behavior/behavior/configure.zcml_insert

Testing the templates
=====================

ZopeSkel provides some doctest based testing facilities to hook your templates
to automatic testing facilities, mainly for the regression testing.

Examples

* http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk/zopeskel/docs/plone3_buildout.txt 

* http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk/zopeskel/docs/localcommands.txt

Testing the generated product
=============================

This checks that your template generates viable code.

Steps 

* Generate a product skeleton using ``paster`` in non-interactive mode

* Run buildout

* Run :doc:`testrunner </testing_and_debugging/unit_testing>` for the created add-on

Developing template egg with paster and buildout.cfg
----------------------------------------------------

The preferred method to run paster with Plone is to have it 
automatically pulled in and configured for you by :doc:`buildout </tutorials/buildout>`.

develop-eggs
============

You need to specially mention to buildout which Python eggs are
in source code form.

* You can use ``develop-eggs`` directive 

* You can use buildout extensions designed for source code and version
  control management, like `mr.developer <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer>`_.
  
Then you need to declare ``[paster]`` part and section in ``buildout.cfg``::

        parts =
            ...
            paster
            
        develop-eggs = 
                src/yourcompany.templates
        
        [paster]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        # Include your own template egg here.
        # Note that ${instance} section name should be the section name
        # for plone.recipe.zope2instance from your buildout.cfg
        eggs = 
                PasteScript 
                ZopeSkel 
                yourcompany.templates
                ${instance:eggs}
                
Rerun buildout.

Now when you run paster command it should show your custom template::

        bin/paster create --list-templates
        ...
        Available templates:
          archetype:          A Plone project that uses Archetypes content types
          basic_namespace:    A basic Python project with a namespace package
          basic_package:      A basic setuptools-enabled package
          basic_zope:         A Zope project
          gomobile_theme:     A theme for Go Mobile for Plone <---- you should see yours somewhere here 
          kss_plugin:         A project for a KSS plugin
