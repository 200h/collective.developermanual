Creating a view
---------------

Example::

	# We must use BrowserView from view, not from zope.browser
	# Zope version does not
	from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

	class MyView(BrowserView):

		def __init__(self, context, request):
			self.context = context
			self.requet = request

		# by default call will call self.index() method which is mapped
		# to ViewPageTemplateFile specified in ZCML
		#def __call__():
		#

Getting a view by id
--------------------

Below is an example how to resolve a view for any contentish object
using traverse. View is also put into acquisition chain using __of__()
method (necessary for rendering Plone templates).

Example::

	def getView(context, name):
	    """ Return a view which is associated with context object and current HTTP request.

		@param context: Any Plone content object
	    @param name: Attribute name holding the view name
	    """


	    try:
	        view = context.unrestrictedTraverse("@@" + name)
	    except AttributeError:
	        raise RuntimeError("Instance %s did not have view %s" % (str(context), name))

	    view = view.__of__(context)

	    return view
