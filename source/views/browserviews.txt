 Views
===============

Plone/Zope uses view pattern to create HTML pages.

Views are usually combination of Python user interface logic class + corresponding page template.

The most usual view type is *BrowserView*

BrowserView classes are a combination of Python object-oriented class code and
page template to produce a HTML page. By keeping as much of the logic code
in a separate Python class and making page template as dump as possible
better component readability and reuse is achieved.

`Read Zope view tutorial <http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/borg/zope-3-views>`_.

Each BrowserView class is callable. BrowserView.__call__()
method acts as an entry point of executing the view code.

Usually BrowserView have also index attribute which
is instance of ViewPageTemplateFile class.
If BrowserView.__call__() is not overridden, it will
return the value of self.index() call.

Internals
---------

Views are Zope component architecture multi-adapter registrations.
If you are doing manual view look-ups then this information concerns you.

Views are looked up by name. Zope publisher does forced
view look-up, instead of traversing, if the traversing name is prefixed with @@.

Views are resolved against different interfaces

* context: Any class/interface. If not given zope.interface.Interface is used (corresponds for="*")

* request: Always HTTP request. Interface zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest is used.

* layer: Theme layer interface. If not given zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IDefaultBrowserLayer is used.

Creating and registering
------------------------

Creating a view
===============

Example::

    # We must use BrowserView from view, not from zope.browser
    # Zope version does not
    from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

    class MyView(BrowserView):

        def __init__(self, context, request):
            self.context = context
            self.request = request

        # by default call will call self.index() method which is mapped
        # to ViewPageTemplateFile specified in ZCML
        #def __call__():
        #

Registering a view
==================

The following example registers a new view

* for="*" means for all content. This equals for registering views
  to zope.interface.Interface base class.

* name is view name (can be used in traversing or multi-adapter look up, explained below)

* Permission is permission needed to render the view, see security chapter

* class is Python dotted name for BrowserView based class which is
  responsible for managing the view. Class __call__() method
  is the entry point for view processing and rendering.

.. code-block:: xml

  <browser:page
        for="*"
        name="test"
        permission="zope2.Public"
        class=".views.MyView"
        />

Creating and register view, grok approach
=========================================

five.grok provides alternative, less verbose, mechanism for above.

See

* `SimpleView chapter in Dexterity manual <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/custom-views/simple-views>`_.

* `Grok view and Grok template <http://grok.zope.org/documentation/tutorial/adder-an-adding-machine-sample-application/a-grok-view>`_.


Relationship between views and templates
----------------------------------------

ZCML <browser:view template=""> will set *index* class attribute.

The default view __call__() method will return the value
returned by self.index() call.

Example::

    <browser:page
        for="*"
        name="test"
        permission="zope2.Public"
        class=".views.MyView"
        />

    from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile

    class MyView(BrowserView):

        index = ViewPageTemplateFile("my-template.pt")


is equal to::

    <browser:page
        for="*"
        name="test"
        permission="zope2.Public"
        class=".views.MyView"
        template="my-template.pt"
        />

    class MyView(BrowserView):
        pass

Rendering of the view is done by following::

    from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile

    class MyView(BrowserView):

        # This may be overridden in ZCML
        index = ViewPageTemplateFile("my-template.pt")

        def render(self):
            return self.index()

        def __call__(self):
            return self.render()


Getting a view by id
--------------------

Below is an example how to resolve a view for any contentish object
using traverse. View is also put into acquisition chain using __of__()
method (necessary for rendering Plone templates).


By using getMultiAdapter
========================

This is the most efficient way in Python.

Example

.. code-block:: python

    from Acquisition import aq_inner
    from zope.component import getMultiAdapter

    def getView(context, request, name):
        # Remove acquisition wrapper which made cause false context assumptions
        context = aq_inner(context)
        # Will raise ComponentLookUpError
        view = getMultiAdapter((context, request), name=name)
        # Put view to acquisition chain
        view = view.__of__(context)
        return view


By using traversing
===================

Traversing is slower than direct getMultiAdapter() call.
However, traversing is available in templates and RestrictedPython modules easily.

Example

.. code-block:: python

    def getView(context, name):
        """ Return a view which is associated with context object and current HTTP request.

        @param context: Any Plone content object
        @param name: Attribute name holding the view name
        """


        try:
            view = context.unrestrictedTraverse("@@" + name)
        except AttributeError:
            raise RuntimeError("Instance %s did not have view %s" % (str(context), name))

        view = view.__of__(context)

        return view

You can also do direct view looks up and method calls in template by using @@Â notation in traversing.

.. code-block:: html

    <div tal:attributes="lang context/@@plone_portal_state/current_language">
        We look up lang attribute by using BrowserView which name is "plone_portal_state"
    </div>


Zope ViewPageTemplateFile vs. Five ViewPageTemplateFile
-------------------------------------------------------

.. *warning*: There are two ViewPageTemplateFile classes with the same name.

* Zope  `BrowserView source code <http://svn.zope.org/zope.publisher/trunk/src/zope/publisher/browser.py?rev=101538&view=auto>`_.

* `Five version  <http://svn.zope.org/Zope/trunk/src/Products/Five/browser/__init__.py?rev=96262&view=markup>`_. Products.Five is a way
  to stick some of Zope 3 technologies to Zope 2 codebase used by Plone.

Difference in code::

    from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile

    vs.

    from zope.app.pagetemplate import ViewPageTemplateFile


Difference is that Five version supports

* Acquisition

* provider: TAL expression

* Other Plone specific TAL expression functions like test()

* Usually Plone code needs Five version of ViewPageTemplateFile

* Some components, no    ly z3c.form, expect Zope 3 version of ViewPageTemplateFile
