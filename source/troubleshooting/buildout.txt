        How to solve problems related to running buildout

Introduction
------------

This document tells how to resolve buildout problems.

Timeouts
---------

The usual reason for download error or timeout is that either

* pypi.python.org server is down

* one of plone.org servers is down

* other Python package source server is down

To figure out which file buildout tries to download, usually the only way
is to use ``buildout -D`` pdb debug mode and step up in stack frames to see 
what is going on.

Version conflicts
-------------------

Buildout gives you an error if there is a dependency shared by two components, and
one of the components wants to have a different version of this dependency.

Example::

      Installing.
      Getting section zeoserver.
      Initializing part zeoserver.
    Error: There is a version conflict.
    We already have: zope.component 3.8.0
    but five.localsitemanager 1.1 requires 'zope.component<3.6dev'.

* If your buildout is fetching out strange versions

	* try running buildout in verbose mode  bin/buildout vvv
	
	* Use helper recipe `dumppickedversions <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildout.dumppickedversions>`_
        

* Manually pindown version in [versions]

Good-py service
==================

Good-py contains some good known versions sets. These are most convenient to use if you are
using complex configuration of add-ons and you don't know what you are doing. 

Some good-py configurations take Plone version as a paremeter.

Example::

        [buildout]
        extends =
            base.cfg
            http://dist.plone.org/release/3.3.5/versions.cfg
            http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0-next?plone=3.3.5

For more information, see

* http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/pre-requisites/buildout-configuration


Plone 3.1
---------

Plone 3.1 and earlier are not eggified. 
Below are links how to keep Plone 3.1 and earlier buildouts running .

Common pindowns
---------------

Here is the latest pindown example (02/2010)::

        [versions]
        # zope.app.catalog 3.6.0 requires zope.index 3.5.0
        # zope.index 3.5.0 requires 'ZODB3>=3.8.0b1'
        # This will conflict with the fake ZODB egg.
        zope.app.catalog = 3.5.2
        zope.component = 3.5.1 
        plone.app.z3cform=0.4.2
        plone.recipe.zope2instance = 3.6
        zope.sendmail = 3.6.0
        Products.PluggableAuthService = 1.6.2
        plone.z3cform = 0.5.8
        five.intid=0.4.2
        plone.reload = 0.11
        Products.GenericSetup = 1.5.0

Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
---------------------------------------

You try to run buildout, but it is stuck in a loop::

	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	Getting distribution for 'distribute'.
	
Your system-wide Distribute version is older than the latest release. Buildout tries to update it, but 
since system wide site-packages version overrides anything buildout can do, it is stuck in a loop.

Fix: update Distribute in system-wide Python::

	easy_install -U Distribute
	Searching for Distribute
