Start Plone as foreground / debug mode
----------------------------------------

Plone runs on the top of Zope application service. Zope is a Python process and will appear
as "python ....." in your task manager process list.

Zope will report any problems with code when it is launched in foreground mode (attached to a terminal).

* Basic command-line knowledge is needed in order to proceed 

First stop Zope if it's running as a background process 

* On Windows: use Plone Control Panel or Windows Control Panel Services section to shutdown Plone first

* On Linux: use /etc/init.d/plone stop or related command to shutdown Plone 

Use the command

.. code-block:: console

        bin/instance fg
        
or Windows command-line command (note that Plone location may depend on where you installed it)

.. code-block:: console
        
        cd "C:\Program files\Plone" 
        bin\instance.exe fg
        
to start Plone.
                      
All errors will be printed into the terminal. 
The error is printed as Python *traceback*. It is important to copy-paste all lines of this traceback,
not just the last line.

If there is no start up error you will see the line 

Check if Plone is up and responds to requests
-----------------------------------------------

Enter to the computer running Plone (SSH in on UNIX).

Use ``telnet`` command to connect Plone port and see if you get valid HTTP response from Plone

.. code-block:: console

     telnet localhost 8080
     
Then do a human HTTP user agent simulation by typing::

     GET / HTTP/1.0<enter><enter>

If you get the answer from Plone (based on HTTP response headers) then 
Plone is running and you have problem elsewhere in your firewall/server/
front-end web server configuration.
