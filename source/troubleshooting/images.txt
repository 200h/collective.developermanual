==================
 Images
==================


Images are not loading
----------------------

Images are not loading. More specifically resize versions are not available.

This is usually caused by broken PIL installation: PIL used by Python virtual machine driving
Plone does not have proper native libraries (libjpeg) available to perform imaging operations.

If you run Zope on foreground you usually see errors like this::

    2009-10-22T17:31:04 ERROR Archetypes None
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/xxx/xxx/parts/plone/Archetypes/Field.py", line 2333, in createScales
        imgdata, format = self.scale(data, w, h)
      File "/home/xxx/xxx/parts/plone/Archetypes/Field.py", line 2382, in scale
        image.thumbnail(size, self.pil_resize_algo)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/PIL/Image.py", line 1523, in thumbnail
        self.load()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/PIL/ImageFile.py", line 155, in load
        self.load_prepare()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/PIL/ImageFile.py", line 223, in load_prepare
        self.im = Image.core.new(self.mode, self.size)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/PIL/Image.py", line 36, in __getattr__
        raise ImportError("The _imaging C module is not installed")
    ImportError: The _imaging C module is not installed


In the above case PYTHONPATH incorrectly tries to load Python 2.5 libraries,
though Plone 3.x exclusively uses Python 2.4. In this case the proper fix
is to clean-up damaged start up scripts in bin/ folder::

    xxx@xxx:~/xxx/bin$ grep -Ri "python2.5" *
    buildout:  '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages',
    instance:  '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages',
    zopepy:  '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages',

This can be achieved by

* Removed all py2.5 eggs under eggs/ folder

* Removing setuptools egg which may contain references to Python 2.5

* Running bootstrap.py using python2.4

* Rerunning buildout after this

How to test if PIL works
========================

Example how to do it with system-wide Python::

    wget http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/JohnCarrollGilbertStuart.jpg

    python2.4

    >>> import PIL
    >>> from PIL import Image
    >>> im = Image.open("JohnCarrollGilbertStuart.jpg")
    >>> im.thumbnail((64, 64), Image.ANTIALIAS)
    >>> im.save("test.jpg")

No exceptions should be risen.

You can do the same thing in Zope console, started by::

    bin/instance debug
