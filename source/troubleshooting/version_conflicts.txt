How to resolve buildout.cfg version conflicts

* If your buildout is fetching out strange versions, try running buildout in verbose mode and figure out from the output which causes the wrong version to be pulled in

::

    bin/buildout vvv

* Manually pindown version in [versions]

* Use `good-py <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/pre-requisites/buildout-configuration>` with `Dexterity configurations <http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity>`_
