Buildout version conflicts
===========================

This document tells how to resolve buildout.cfg version conflicts.
Buildout gives you an error if there is a dependency shared by two components, and
one of the components wants to have a different version of this dependency.

Example::

      Installing.
      Getting section zeoserver.
      Initializing part zeoserver.
    Error: There is a version conflict.
    We already have: zope.component 3.8.0
    but five.localsitemanager 1.1 requires 'zope.component<3.6dev'.

* If your buildout is fetching out strange versions

	* try running buildout in verbose mode  bin/buildout vvv
	
	* Use helper recipe `dumppickedversions <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildout.dumppickedversions>`_
        

* Manually pindown version in [versions]

* Use `good-py <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/pre-requisites/buildout-configuration>`_ with `Dexterity configurations <http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity>`_
