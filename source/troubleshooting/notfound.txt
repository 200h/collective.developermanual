Here are listed possible issues if you get Plone's "Page not found" page when trying to access a legimate URL.


Cannot access @@manage-portlets
-------------------------------

There might be portlet naming issue. Portlet name referred in GenericSetup XML
or previously installed add-on product is not anymore available in the system.

Possible solutions:

* Make sure that portlet name is the same in ZCML and GenericSetup XML

* Make sure you use <include package=".portlets" /> in your code

* Reinstall removed egg which has the code for the portlet
