        How to write log output from your Plone add-on program code

.. contents:: :local:

Introduction
-------------

`Python logging package <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_ is used to log from Plone.

Log file location
==================

By default, logs go to ``var/log/instance.log``. If Zope instance is started in the foreground mode
logs will be printed in the console (stdout) too.

Log level 
=========

Default log level is ``INFO``. To enable more verbose logging, edit ``buildout.cfg``,

Change log level by editing ``[instance]`` section ``event-log-level``::

        [instance]
        event-log-level = debug

Logging from Python code
------------------------

Example::

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("Plone")

    class MySomething(object):
        ...
        def function(self):
            logger.info("Reached function()")
            ...

Logging from page templates and RestrictedPython scripts
--------------------------------------------------------

Python ``logging`` module doesn't provide Zope 2 security assertations
and does not work in :doc:`RestrictedPython Python scripts </security/sandboxing>`_.

However, you can use ``context.plone_log()`` method logging in the sandboxed execution mode.

Example::

    context.plone_log("This is so fun")
