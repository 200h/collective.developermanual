Introduction
------------

z3c.recipe.i18n is a buildout recipe to manage internationalization
of Python source code egg.

It integrates well with :doc:`buildout </tutorials/buildout>` 
configuration and deployment tool and provides shortcuts
for many frequently executed tasks.

For more information see

* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.recipe.i18n

Installation
------------

Each translation domain gets its own i18n section in buildout.cfg.
Because each Python package uses its own translation domain, this effectively
translates to one z3c.recipe.i18n section per package.
