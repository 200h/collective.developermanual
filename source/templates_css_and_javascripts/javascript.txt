        How to add your own Javascript files to Plone and Plone add-on products

.. contents:: local

Introduction
------------

Plone Javascripts are managed by resource registry *portal_javascripts*.
You can find this in Zope Management interface, under your portal root folder.

portal_javascript will automatically

* compress JS files

* merge JS load requests

* determine which files are included on which HTML page

* support IE conditional comments

Creating Javascripts for Plone
------------------------------

The following ste

* Put ZMI -> portal_javascripts to debug mode

* Include new JS files 

        * Use ZCML configuration directive :doc:`resourceFolder /templates_css_and_javascripts/resourcefolders> to
          include static media files in your add-on product

        * Put in new Javascript via ZMI upload (you can use Page Template type) to portal_skins/custom folder

* Register Javascript in portal_javascripts

        * Do it through-the-web using portal_javascripts ZMI user interface ...or...
        
        * Add *profiles/default/jsregistry.xml* file to describe Javascript files included with your add-on product 
       
Executing Javascript code on page load
--------------------------------------

Plone includes JQuery library which has ``ready()``
event handler to run Javascript code when DOM tree
loading is done (HTML is loaded, images and media files
are not necesssarily loaded).

Create following snippet::


    jq(document).ready(function() {
        // TODO: Execute your page manipulating Javascript code here
    });

Registering javascripts to portal_javascripts
---------------------------------------------

Javascript files need to be registered in order to appear in Plone's <html> <head>
and in the Javascript merge compositions.

Javascripts are registered to portal_javascripts tool using *profiles/default/jsregistry.xml* GenericSetup
profile file.

* `More information about jsregistry.xml <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/theme-reference/page/css/resource-registries/practical2>`_.

The following options are available

* *id* (required): URI from where the Javascript is loaded

* *expression* empty string or TAL condition which determintes whether the file is served to the user.
  The files with the same condition are grouped to the same compression bundle. For more information,
  see :doc:`expressions documentation </functionality/expressions>`.

* *cookable* is merging of Javascript files allowed during the compression

* *inline* is script server as inline inside <script>...</script> tag

* *enabled* shortcut to disable some Javascripts

* *compression* none, safe or full. See full option list from portal_javascripts.

* *insert-before* and *insert-after* control the position of the Javascript file
  in relation to other served Javascript files

`Full description in the source code <https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/ResourceRegistries/trunk/Products/ResourceRegistries/exportimport/resourceregistry.py>`_.

Example ``profiles/default/jsregistry.xml`` in your add-on product

..code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <object name="portal_javascripts">
            <javascript
                id="++resource++plonetheme.yourproduct/cufon-yui.js"
                cacheable="True" compression="safe" cookable="True"
                enabled="True" expression=""  inline="False" insert-after="toc.js"/>
        </object>

Bundles
=======

There are several compressed Javascript bundles cooked (compressed & merged)
from Javascript definitions automatically.

* Anonymous users (no condition)

* Logged in users (condition: not: portal/portal_membership/isAnonymousUser)

* Visual editor (Kupu) related Javascripts (condition: python:portal.kupu_library_tool.isKupuEnabled(REQUEST=request))

To inspect bundles and whether Javascripts have been registered succesfully,
go to portal_javascripts -> Merged composition tab in ZMI.

Javascript for anonymous
========================

The following example includes Javascript file intended for anonymous site users.
It is included after toc.js so that the file ends up to anonymous users compression bundle.

The Javascript file itself is in folder plonetheme/xxx/browser/scripts and it is
mapped to ++resource++plonetheme.xxx.scripts namespace using <resourceDirectotory>
ZCML directive.

If insert-after or insert-before is omitted, the script will end up as the last
of the Javascript registry.

Example *profiles/default/jsregistry.xml*

.. code-block:: xml

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<object name="portal_javascripts">
	    <javascript
	        id="++resource++plonetheme.xxx.scripts/cufon-yui.js"
	        cacheable="True" compression="safe" cookable="True"
	        enabled="True" expression=""  inline="False" insert-after="toc.js"/>
	</object>

The following example registers an anonymous user Javascript file, but does
no place it to the compression bundle, because it is very big and
slows down the page loading. It is placed before dropdown.js
which is the first script for logged in users.

.. code-block:: xml

    <javascript
        id="++resource++plonetheme.xxx.scripts/XXX_Script_400.font.js"
        cacheable="True" compression="none" cookable="False"
        enabled="True" expression=""  inline="False" insert-before="dropdown.js"/>
