====================
 Resource folders
====================

Resource folders are Zope 3 way to expose static media files to
Plone URL mapping.


GROK way
========

The easiest way to manage static resources is to make use of the static resource directory feature in five.grok.
Simply add a directory called static in the package and make sure that the <grok:grok package="." />
line appears in configure.zcml.

If a static resource directory in the example.conference package contains a file called conference.css,
it will be accessible on a URL like http://<server>/site/++resource++example.conference/conference.css.
The resource name is the same as the package name wherein the static directory appears.

More manual way
===============

If you want to customize media folder mapping point, you need to use
Zope 3's resourceDirectory directive.
