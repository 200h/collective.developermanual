Introduction
-------------

Plone uses `TAL` template language which has `METAL <>`_ extensions for macros. TALES expressiong

Plone 3 has two kind of template

    * View page templates. They have associated *view* template variable. These templates live under browser/
      folder structure in your add-on product. You can override them by <browser:page> ZCML directive.

    * Old style page templates. They live under plone_skins structure in ZMI and. You can
      override them by register a new plone_skins layer. The most infamous of them is main_template
      which provides skeleton for all Plone themes.

See `browser:page <http://apidoc.zope.org/++apidoc++/ZCML/http_co__sl__sl_namespaces.zope.org_sl_browser/page/index.html>`_

TAL
---

`TAL <http://wiki.zope.org/ZPT/TALSpecification14>`_ is template language used Plone.
TAL is XML based language, which puts programming logic to XML attributes.

Escaped and unescaped content
=============================

By default, all TAL output is escaped for the security reasons.

.. code-block:: python

	view.text = "<b>Test</b>"

.. code-block:: html

	<div tal:content="view/text" />
	
Will output escaped HTML source code::

	&lt;b&gt;Testlt;/b&gt;
	
Unescaped content can be outputted using tal:replace attribute and structure.

.. code-block:: html

	<div tal:replace="structure view/text" />
	
Will output unescaped HTML source code::

	<b>Test</b>

METAL
------

METAL is TAL extension to provide macros and slots to the template language.

Using METAL macros is no longer recommended, since they couple 
programming logic too tightly with the template language.
You should use views instead.

TALES expressions are condition clauses used in TAL templates and various other parts of Plone
