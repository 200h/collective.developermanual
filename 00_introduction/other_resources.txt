`Plone Trac <https://dev.plone.org/>`_ contains bug reports, Plone source code and commits. Useful when you encounter a new exception or you are looking for a reference how to use API. 

`Zope 3 API reference <http://apidoc.zope.org/>`_. Good source for up-to-date Zope Python API and ZCML references.

`Zope 2 book <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/source/>`_. This describes old Zope 2 technologies. The book is mostly good explaining some old things, but '''do not''' use it as a reference for building new things.

`Kaizen Plone <http://www.kaizenplone.org/>`_ problem oriented recipes to solve Plone problems.
